# AGSUnpacker
A program to work with *compiled* Adventure Game Studio (AGS) engine resources.

It features extraction of game assets from executable (\*.exe) or archive files (\*.ags, \*.xxx), unpacking and repacking of sprites (\*.spr), previewing and changing room backgrounds (\*.crm), generating translation files (\*.trs, \*.tra), replacing strings directly in scripts and more.

Written in .NET C#.

For AGS script (scom3) **decompilation** refer to [Ghidra ReAGS](https://github.com/adm244/Ghidra-ReAGS).\
For game specific script **patches** refer to [ags-translations-fixes](https://github.com/adm244/ags-translations-fixes).

Development versions can be downloaded from [Actions](https://github.com/adm244/AGSUnpacker/actions) tab.

## Supported versions

This project aims to support **all officially released** 2.x and 3.x AGS versions. It includes support for obsolete engines before 2.54 that have no support in publically released source code.

Original Adventure Creator 1.x and all future AGS 4.x (this includes 3.99.x) or custom versions are beyond the scope (for now).

## Compilation

### Install .NET SDK

For windows host you can use .NET 6 or .NET 8. If you're cross-compiling on linux then prefer .NET 8.

On Windows:

- Download and install [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

On Linux:

- Depending on the distribution install either from your distro repository or follow [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux) from M\*.

### Get source code

Clone repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/adm244/AGSUnpacker.git
```
or [download](https://github.com/adm244/AGSUnpacker/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) master branch and unpack it.

### Build using makefile

In terminal navigate to AGSUnpacker root folder and use provided makefile to build:
```sh
make publish CONFIG=Release ARCH=x64
```
or to compile 32-bit executables:
```sh
make publish CONFIG=Release ARCH=x86
```

If everything went OK you'll find compiled program in `build/package` folder.

### Build using dotnet

*If you can't use `make` then follow this instructions.*

In terminal navigate to AGSUnpacker root folder and use this dotnet command:
```sh
dotnet publish AGSUnpacker.UI/AGSUnpacker.UI.csproj --os win -c Release -a x64 --no-self-contained /p:TargetOS="win" -o build/package/
```
or to compile 32-bit executables:
```sh
dotnet publish AGSUnpacker.UI/AGSUnpacker.UI.csproj --os win -c Release -a x86 --no-self-contained /p:TargetOS="win" -o build/package/
```

If everything went OK you'll find compiled program in `build/package` folder.
